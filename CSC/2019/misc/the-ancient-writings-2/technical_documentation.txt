- The final code will be assembled from three parts
  1) the first part of the code is "cscbe19_medium_pre.bf" (and can be found here: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/be.cscbe.challenges.2019/UnravelingTheAncientWritings%232_e9b58eb59b66d0320645d56eab431f65/cscbe19_medium_pre.bf)
  2) the second part (the missing line) has to be provided by you (more details below)
  3) the third part of the code is "cscbe19_medium_post.bf" (and can be found here: https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/be.cscbe.challenges.2019/UnravelingTheAncientWritings%232_e9b58eb59b66d0320645d56eab431f65/cscbe19_medium_post.bf)

- This resulting final code will be run using the reference implementation interpreter for this language
- The output of running the final code with the interpreter should be exactly the same as in the easy challenge (i.e. the flag of the easy challenge)
- when the code genertates the correct output you will be awarded with ...

Your input
++++++++++
- you have to submit "the second part" (2) discussed above
- a single line, max 80 characters
- all characters are in the Ascii range 0x20 - 0x7f
- a newline (0x0a) will be added when to your input when assembling the final code
    1)
    2) + "\n"
    3)

- You have to submit your input to a webserver running at 52.210.193.145 on port 4242 at the URL /bef/medium/your_input_here

  So if you believe that the missing line is "  v *37 <   "   (minus the quotes which are here for readability)

  You would make the request
